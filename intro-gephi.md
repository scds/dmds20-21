# Network Analysis with Gephi

Graph data, expressing relationships between entities, is another type of data that can be useful to visualize for scholars. We will use a visualization tool intended for social network analysis, [Gephi](https://gephi.org/), to map and identify relationships within a dataset scraped from Twitter.

**The recording and materials for this workshop are available here**: <https://learn.scds.ca/intro-gephi/>
