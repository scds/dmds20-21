# Data Wrangling with OpenRefine
	
In this workshop, participants will learn the basic principles of data wrangling, and will use a hands-on approach to gain fundamental knowledge and practical experience with exploring, cleaning, and transforming data into more interoperable and reusable forms.

## Facilitator Bio

Jay Brodeur (he/him) brings to the Centre years of experience working with data in a wide variety of formats and interdisciplinary contexts. A scientist by training with a PhD in Earth and Environmental Sciences, he’s comfortable working and advising on all kinds of data-related activities, ranging from data wrangling and integration to analysis and mapping to research data management. Jay’s also keenly interested in the application of digital approaches to support experiential learning opportunities within and outside of the classroom.

## Workshop Preperation

For this workshop, you will need [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) and a web browser. Follow the [instructions](https://datacarpentry.org/openrefine-socialsci/setup.html) provided by the Data Carpentries to install OpenRefine on your system (whether it is Window, Mac, or Linux).

When you have OpenRefine installed and working, proceed to the introductory presentation for a primer on data wrangling.

## Learn More

After ensuring that you’ve followed the Preparatory steps to install OpenRefine, navigate to the Data Carpentries’ [Open Refine for Social Science Data](https://datacarpentry.org/openrefine-socialsci/) workshop page and follow along with the hands-on tutorial.

And note that though the workshop uses Social Sciences data, the approaches used in this workshop are applicable in many other disciplines.

## Additional Resources

The [OpenRefine home page](https://openrefine.org/) has a variety of tutorials and documentation to learn more about using OpenRefine.
